## üëã Welcome to Archbee!

We're stoked to have you here :)
:::

## üé∏ Get rolling with the editor

*   [ ] Click anywhere and start typing
*   [ ] Highlight any text, and use the menu to **style** *your *~~writing~~ `however` *you like;* or use Markdown shortcuts to format,* like ## or \*\** &#x20;
*   [ ] Go to a new row and type **/ **to add blocks; add anything from **lists,** **tables** to **diagrams** and **API docs **(OpenAPI or GraphQL) or embed [30+ other software ](https://www.archbee.io/integrations)like Figma, Loom, Airtable;
*   [ ] Go to a new row and type @ to link documents or mention people in your workspace
*   [ ] To the left are your collections, an easy way to hierarchically organize your docs
*   [ ] Collections can be shared on your own domain, and it looks like [docs.pathfix.com](https://docs.pathfix.com) or even our own docs [docs.archbee.io](https://docs.archbee.io).

    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?
    loop Healthcheck
        John->>John: Fight against hypochondria

    Note right of John: Rational thoughts <br/>prevail!
    John-->>Alice: Great!
    John->>Bob: How about you?

  "method": "GET",
  "headers": {
    "Accept": "application/json"
  }
})
.then(response => {
  console.log(response);
})
.catch(err => {
  console.error(err);
});
```

```nodejs
const fetch = require('node-fetch');

let url = 'https://api.cakes.com/v1/cakes/:id';
let options = {
  method: 'GET', 
headers: {
    Accept: 'application/json',
  }
};
fetch(url, options)
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(json => console.log(json))
  .catch(err => console.error('error:' + err));
```

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.cakes.com/v1/cakes/:id"
headers = {"Accept": "application/json"}
response = requests.request("GET", url, headers=headers)
print(response.text)
```
